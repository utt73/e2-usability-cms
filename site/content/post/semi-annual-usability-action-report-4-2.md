## Purpose and Overview

The following describes the CW Government Travel., Inc. (d.b.a CWTSatoTravel) Semi-Annual Usability Action Report (SAUAR) for ETS2 E2 Solutions. This document is required by section D.40.hh of the GSA ETS2 Master Contract GS-33-FAA009.

Twice per year, CWTSatoTravel delivers a SAUAR to the PMO within 30 days prior to the Semi-Annual Performance Review. The SAUAR is provided to report on usability and user experience of the ETS2 E2 Solutions product, detailing usability assurance activities during the previous six months, and communicate status and progress of the usability program to ETS2 E2 Solutions system stakeholders. Each SAUAR will describe any changes to key personnel in our cross-functional usability team since the previous SAUAR, provide a summary of any completed system changes or enhancements that are intended to improve usability, as well as any usability or accessibility (e.g., Section 508) audit findings performed during the period of review. Recurring usability indicators -- measures of efficiency, effectiveness, web performance and customer satisfaction -- as well as the major findings from ongoing usability evaluation activities will be detailed. Known plans to correct or mitigate usability and accessibility issues will be documented in the SAUAR in the context of an updated ETS2 E2 Solutions product roadmap.

As specified in D.40.hh, the SAUAR reports on CWTSatoTravel’s disciplined and iterative approach to User-Centered Design (UCD) and Usability Engineering (UE), including but not limited to efforts to complete user-centered design and usability engineering analyses, evaluations/tests, corrective actions to mitigate identified usability problems, and/or upgrades. The Semi-Annual Usability Action Report shall provide updates on the following:

1.  Changes in key Contractor ETS2 UCD/UE team personnel;
2.  Overview of any user interface design changes or enhancements;
3.  Documentation of the findings from any Accessibility Audits or other Section
    508 compliance activities, including any corrective actions planned or
    completed;
4.  Updates to any recurring usability indicators being tracked on a semi-annual
    basis in keeping with the Contractor’s User-Centered Design/Usability
    Assurance Plan, such as:
    1. Efficiency indicators, such as:
        * Time taken by users to complete ETS2 tasks (such as those specified in ETS2 Use Cases)
        * Time taken by users to complete end-to-end ETS2 transactional processes
        * Time taken by users to access online help information

    2.  Effectiveness indicators, such as:
        *  User rates of completing ETS2 tasks
        *  User rates of abandoning tasks
        *  Various errors or types of errors

    3.  Satisfaction indicators, such as:
        *  Analysis of comments and questionnaire data from Usability Tests
        *  Customer satisfaction survey data
        *  User focus group and/or interview data

5.  Documentation of the findings from any usability evaluation activities
    undertaken in the preceding six months, such as:
    1.  Usability audits based on inspection by qualified usability
        professionals
    2.  Task-based usability testing with representative users attempting
        typical ETS2 tasks
    3.  Observations of users in their work environment
    4.  User customer satisfaction surveys
    5.  Analysis and reviews of click-stream web logs, including error
        conditions, online help access incidents, and task times and
        completion/abandonment data
    6.  Analysis and reviews of Help Desk incidents logged as usability issues
    7.  Feedback gleaned from user during ETS2 training

6.  Contractor progress in mitigating identified usability issues in relation to
    the Contractor’s software development life cycle, release schedule, and
    Technology Refresh plans.

## Executive Summary

CWTSatoTravel is committed to incorporating best practices in usability improvement, user-centered design, and usability engineering into the ETS2 E2 Solutions software development lifecycle and service delivery. These practices are part of our usability-centered continuous improvement program, involving iterative and ongoing usability improvement activities. Our goals are measurable continual improvements to the efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction levels of the ETS2 E2 Solutions product and service. The period of performance (POP) of this SAUAR is **July 1 – December 31, 2018**. During this POP, the E2 Solutions team continues to focus resources on agency implementations and enhancements, development of new features and functionalities, and expanding usability assurance activities. Key points within these areas: 

-   There have been no changes to key UCD/UE personnel;
-   Several changes have been implemented to improve usability within E2
    Solutions and the online booking engine (GetThere);
-   The restructured E2 Solutions User Interface continues to have both significantly increased the amount of work completed per user session, in significantly reduced time;
-   CWTSatoTravel continued collaboration following data and guidance learned from the GSA’s ETSNext initiative;
-   GetThere and CWTSatoTravel completed 15 remote user interviews from multiple agencies focusing on OBE hotel attachment, quick book, and expenses;
-   CWTSatoTravel completed 8 in-person TAVS user interviews with State users and admins in October. A third session was scheduled with USAID, however, all but 1 intended traveler became unavailable late so the session was canceled;
-   E2 Solutions continues development and testing to meet WCAG 2.0 AA success criteria under the Revised Section 508 Standards;
-   Migration of web analytics from Adobe SiteCatalyst to Google Analytics. Expected completion is R2019.2;
-   Information architecture evaluations and prototype redevelopment of Mobile Shop First and User Profile is underway.

## Contractor ETS2 UCD/UE Team Key Personnel Updates

### Key Personnel 

During this reporting period, there were no changes to key personnel as identified in the ETS2 Master Contract on the E2 Solutions UCD/UE team:

-   John Utter, Usability Assurance Manager (UAM)
-   Ann Reubish, Service Technical Lead
-   Laura Kistler, Director, Products & Services Marketing

### UCD/UE Cross-functional Team 

The UCD/UE team consists of a cross-section of E2 Solutions team members from Quality Assurance, Product Support, Development, and Business Analysis. The UCD/UE team continues to work with our third-party vendors, GetThere, our online booking tool provider, and Oracle RightNow Technologies (RNT), our help desk issue tracking tool, to ensure usability issues with their products are documented and addressed.

Participation in usability efforts extends beyond the UCD/UE team. Program Managers, Trainers, Help Desk Analysts, Business Analysts, Developers, Quality Assurance Analysts, and Product Owners support usability improvements in their departments. CWTSatoTravel has specific teams within these groups focused on usability efforts, as does GetThere. Our UAM “runs point,” and reports to the director-level. The UAM and directors work across teams to drive usability and accessibility improvements across product lines, teams, partners, and subcontractors.

Usability testing is proctored at agencies by the UAM, supported by other employees and partners. These cross-functional groups gain deep insight by speaking directly with users of the software they create. The UAM designs these sessions to be a high-growth opportunity and welcomes the GSA’s participation also.

-   *CY2016* -- in-person testing was conducted by the UAM, Director, Trainers, Program Managers, and GetThere representative.
-   *CY2017* -- the UAM, Director, Software Development Manager, Senior Business Analyst, and Senior Product Director executed in-person and remote UX evaluations during the POP. GetThere representatives also attended and executed UX evaluations.
-   *CY2018* -- in-person and remote testing was conducted by the UAM, Director, Program Managers, Senior Business Analyst, QA Manager and GetThere; focused on users at major and minor agencies new to participating in evaluations.

#### Restructured E2 Solutions User Interface

Documented in detail in Release Notes and previous SAUAR, the E2 Solutions team is continuing on a modernization effort to update the E2 Solutions user interface. The changes are focused on how information is presented while preserving the baseline content and workflow. Our goals for the user interface include:

-   Reduce screen "noise" and declutter the workflow.
-   More cohesive integration between the travel and expense application and the online booking tool.
-   Meeting Revised Section 508 Refresh accessibility standards in effect January 18, 2018.

The updated UI was first made available by feature flag in March 2018; Agency customers could turn on the new look when they were ready. All Agencies migrated automatically in the fall of 2018. These investments in clear and consistent UI and fast application response appears to return remarkable gains in user-work completed and significantly reduced time.

#### Section 508 Refresh — Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA

Updates to E2 Solutions to conform to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 AA success criteria. These updates enhance accessibility to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for people with disabilities and meet the revised Section 508 standards (published 18 January 2017).

#### Search for Documents

Search for Documents is a new feature in E2 Solutions that allows administrators to search for travel documents (including voucher payments). Administrators can search for documents when they have at least one User Settings administrator permission checked.

Search for Documents is intended to replace the Search Trips feature. Search Trips will be removed in a future release of E2 Solutions.

#### Flight Card Indicator 

A caret was added to the flight card to indicate to the user that an action is
required to open the card and view more information. The indicator will also
display on the card when the drawer is expanded to indicate it can be closed.

#### Home Page Configuration

Cosmetic cleanup and configuration was applied to the home page of the online
booking tool. Functionality has not changed, but users will now notice a
different look to the page.

Figure 4: Updated OBE Home Page


#### Air Shopping Enhancements 


Updates were made to the online booking tool to improve the air shopping
experience.

-   Using the "Search by time" feature, travelers will now see full pricing,
    including taxes and fees, for flights returned in the search results.
-   The availability and pricing selection was enhanced to not only verify the
    fares, but to also determine whether prices are available before they are
    shown to the traveler.
-   The OBT will now display flights with the contract carrier before all others
    in the search results, including when the traveler chooses to search for the
    "lowest available" fare.
-   The OBT will evaluate the fare rules to ensure contract fares are only
    displayed for valid connecting cities.

#### Airports Layover Filter

A "Layover" section was added to the Airports filter that is available when
shopping for flights. This section displays when search results include trips
with connection/layover airports. Clear the check box (i.e., click in the check
box to remove the check mark) of any layover airport you do not want to include
in the search results.

Figure 9: Airports Layover Filter — Search by Price (Select a Flight page)

#### Hotel Name Filter: Brand Name 

The Hotel Name filter on the Select a Hotel page now allows you to filter the
search results by brand name. A hotel "brand" is a family of hotel chains under
a single brand name.

## Recurring Usability Indicators

Usability has an international standard definition in ISO 9241 pt. 11 (ISO, 1998), which defined usability as the "*extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use.*" We further define software usability in terms of the following attributes:

##### 1. Efficiency 
* Time taken to complete critical tasks
* Time taken to complete end-to-end processes
* Time taken by users to access online help information for critical areas

##### 2. Effectiveness 
* User rates of completing critical tasks
* User rates of abandoning critical tasks
* Rates and types of errors

##### 3. Satisfaction  
* Analysis and comments and questionnaire data from usability tests
* Analysis of customer satisfaction survey data
* Analysis of user focus group and interview data

##### 4. Performance 
* Front-end website performance
* Browser incompatibilities and bottlenecks
* Page rendering and performance
* User’s perceived site performance

These attributes provide comprehensive measurable ways to assess the usability of the ETS2 E2 Solutions product. Usability tests contain some combination of completion rates, errors, task times, task-level satisfaction, test-level satisfaction, help access, and lists of usability problems including frequency and severity.

There are generally two types of usability tests: finding and fixing usability problems (*formative tests*) and describing the usability of an application using metrics (*summative tests*). The bulk of E2 Solutions’ usability testing is formative. It is often a small-sample qualitative activity where the data takes the form of problem descriptions to inform design recommendations and development priority.

CWTSatoTravel usability reporting metrics of the ETS2 E2 Solutions product include feedback sources such as the self-audit, UX evaluations, help desk logs, and customer discussions that include training sessions, focus and user groups.

### Efficiency

Web analytic tools capture meaningful information regarding E2 Solutions usage at scale. In order to accurately gauge system usability, our team measures and tracks subjective usability indicators and benchmarks over time, and across different user roles. These indicators include web analytic data generated by production E2 Solutions system usage. Configuration to capture more complete usability indicators from these tools began collecting data in production with the 16.4 release. In addition to efficiency metrics discussed elsewhere in this report, other metrics of interest observed during POP include:

-   Currently the average unique role user visits E2 Solutions:
    -   Traveler -- 2-3 times per month
    -   Approver -- 6-8 times per month
    -   Auditor -- 8-15 times per month
    -   Admin -- 2-5 times per month

-   Across user roles, \~28,941 weekday uniques (18% increase since last SAUAR) visited 31.54 pages per session (15% increase since last SAUAR). Increased user activity likely from a cleaner UI, advancing familiarity with workflow process and gains related to page response times from front-end optimization. Users may complete multiple workflow tasks within one session.

-   Travelers completed their tasks on average of 29:19 minutes, about a 14.6 minute improvement (\~33% faster than last SAUAR). This data is referencing the user’s session. More specific end-to-end task workflow metrics are included within the SAUAR, such as average task completion and fallout for authorizations, vouchers and local vouchers.
-   Recent investments in clear and consistent UI and fast application response appears to return remarkable gains in user-work completed in significantly reduced time.
-   Over the month of June 2018, the 14.6 minutes task reduction average among 450,138 traveler logins is the equivalent of 109,533 workhours saved compared to pre-UI Refresh travelers (October 2017).

<figcaption>Figure 11: Daily Unique Visitors Report</figcaption>

-   Users checking a document status and then exiting accounted for about 24-30%
    of site traffic . We are exploring methods to better
    communicate document status to these users.

-   E2 Solutions is continuing to see significant returns in user efficiency, with ~15% more pages viewed per session in ~30% less time.

#### Mobile Users

-   Mobile users remain iOS-centric. E2 Solutions receives about 75% mobile users from iOS platforms.
-   Mobile use of TAVS continues to spike on weekends and holidays when typically away from the office. E2 users would appear to accept a mobile-first TAVS and further UI refinement to benefit mobile users.

### Effectiveness

CWTSatoTravel and GetThere may evaluate the effectiveness of E2 Solutions application during the POP of this report with User Experience Evaluations. User Evaluation info and results can be found under [*Usability Audits*](#UsabilityAudits).

User fallout, exit pages and abandons are discussed in [*Completion Data, Task Conversion and Abandonment Data*](#CompletionData).

### User Satisfaction

GSA conducted the ETS2 Customer Satisfaction Survey during this POP scored upon common SUS questions, receiving 3,704 responses.

Since 2017, GSA determines the contract score as the average sum of all survey respondent’s answers to the 20 Likert-scored questions. Though all are weighted equally, the results of the Overall Satisfaction question has been shown to be significantly higher than the contract score. Users can be generally unsatisfied with some part of the support, itinerary, policy, or reimbursement but satisfied with the product or service – for example, in 2017 the contract score was 68, but users rated Overall Satisfaction at 72.

The GSA survey unfortunately was closed days before the UI Refresh was pushed to Production. Initial 2018 results were provided by the GSA in June: with E2 Solutions scoring 69.38, a modest improvement upon 2017’s 68.03.

CWTSatoTravel looks forward to the full 2018 detailed results and the deep value found when comparing YOY results with similar survey methodology.

### Tracking Overall User Satisfaction 

[SUS is what Usability.gov recommends](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html) for ETS2 monitoring usability metrics over time. E2 Solutions is approaching average SUS: [The mean SUS is a 68](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html).
From https://measuringu.com/sus/ 

>   “You’d need to score above an 80.3 to get an A (the top 10% of scores). This is also the point where users are more likely to be recommending the product to a friend. Scoring at the mean score of 68 gets you a C and anything below a 51 is an F (putting you in the bottom 15%).”

SUS, NPS, GSA Contract Score, and user response to “Overall Satisfaction” survey questions are charted below using available historic data from usability studies and customer satisfaction surveys completed by CWT, GetThere, GSA, and Deloitte to try to visualize related usability scores over time. NPS variance appears more sensitive to user opinion due to a higher weight, lower frequency single question and is simplest to gather from volunteers.

When not surveyed in the respective evaluation, SUS and NPS was estimated using the [SUS-NPS regression equation and converter](https://measuringu.com/nps-sus/) by Jeff Sauro and Jim Lewis at *Measuring Usability* was used to complete estimates for this graph. The work of Sauro and Lewis are referenced at least three times on usability.gov, including directly from the [usability.gov SUS method page](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html).  Our Usability Assurance Manager considers SUS and NPS to be somewhat interchangeable. Further, Sauro and Lewis found,

>  “*The percentage of variation in LTR [NPS] explained by SUS was about 7% (corresponding to a statistically significant correlation of about .606). If you have existing SUS scores from usability evaluations,* [you can use either of these regression equations](https://measuringu.com/nps-sus/) *to estimate LTR, and from those LTR estimates, compute the corresponding estimated NPS.*”

Datapoints in *italics* below are converted estimates, when one or the other was not available or measured in the particular survey. For future data collection, it is a small effort to collect ratings of NPS in addition to the SUS rather than estimating it, as NPS consists of one single question. It is not practical to gather SUS results with users from prior user evaluations.  Where appropriate during future usability examinations, UAM will include the 10 SUS statements within exit-question surveys.

## Performance 

CWTSatoTravel measures and monitors system performance on a recurring basis to
diagnose and prevent impacts to the user community.

### Server Response Time Monitoring

CWTSatoTravel conducts a synthetic test (i.e., a robotic process vs. end user data) on web page response times for key steps within the E2 Solutions application workflow as a gauge of system performance. These tests provide a measure of performance independent of factors outside of our control, such as the user’s bandwidth and network latency. CWTSatoTravel monitors the results of these tests to determine if action needs to be taken to address any system performance issues that may negatively impact the user experience with E2 Solutions.

Non-maintenance performance events during the POP:

-   May 14, 2018 at 3:23 p.m. to 5:07 p.m. Users accessing the UAT environment
    experienced an Internal Service Error
-   April 20, 6:12 a.m. to 6:26 a.m. CT: E2 Production was unavailable.
-   March 30: Users accessing the UAT environment may experience intermittent
    issues of slow response time or getting logged out of the E2 UAT
    environment.
-   March 9, 2018 at 3:30 p.m. to 6:05 p.m. CT: E2Solutions was unable to
    connect to GDSx.
-   During early February and again February 22-23rd, the E2 Solutions
    application service experienced several instances of system latency.

For detailed information, please see E2 Solutions Notification alert emails.

### Front-end Optimization (FEO)

Measuring and reporting front-end web performance helps deliver a productive and fast experience. Complex web applications like E2 Solutions and modern browsers have multifaceted interaction, such as ajax, lazyloading, preloading, async-loading, fonts, and responsive design that build the application’s user experience. CWTSatoTravel continues to expand the awareness and scope of front-end optimization system performance testing and data collection program. The goal is to observe web metrics to give developers and operations staff better awareness and insight into what users are experiencing and to track front-end optimization results over time.

CWTSatoTravel tracks how design and code changes impact what users see and how quickly they see it on mobile, tablet and desktop. Site waterfall reports, page load time and total download size, network bandwidth utilization, HTTP headers and front-end performance issues are examined and placed into Test Director for resolution (e.g., combine external styles and scripts, leverage browser and proxy caching).

Modern web interfaces are getting heavier and heavier, the [median payload for desktop sites is now over 1.8MB](https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight#bytesTotal) analyzing [HTTPArchive.org](https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web?start=latest) data. The E2 Solutions interface is designed and coded to avoid this trend and keep the application snappy and fast.

Real-world network waterfalls between common unprimed- and primed-cache browsers that access E2 Solutions have been discussed in previous SAUARs.

What follows is tracking of “first paint” and “load” events on common pages across release cycles, hardware and software performance improvements, browsers, and cache status.

-   The IE11 JavaScript engine is not robust which penalizes real-world site speed and responsiveness. JavaScript files also download and execute sequentially in IE, not in parallel as in other browsers. CWTSatoTravel observes users migrating away from IE11 as Agency IT policy allows for browser choice.

-   Users returning to E2 Solutions within 30 days should have all UI-necessary external images, styles, and JavaScript files cached -- unless they have cleared their browser cache.

## Findings from Usability Evaluations

### <a name="UsabilityAudits"></a>Usability Audits 
-   An accessibility audit of the CWTSato To Go mobile app for Android was performed. Findings were provided to the mobile application development team for remediation.
-   GetThere and CWTSatoTravel completed 15 remote 60-minute user interviews focusing on OBE hotel
    attachment, quick book, and expenses in September.
-    CWTSatoTravel completed 8 in-person 90-minute TAVS user interviews with State users and admins in October. 
-   Online-based information architecture evaluations for Mobile Shop First and User Profile have been
    prepared and evaluated with internal stakeholders.

### Considerations regarding obtaining usability study participants 

Uncompensated volunteers willing to leave their work tasks to altruistically participate in a study are difficult to find. CWTSatoTravel often arranges to meet Federal users at their own work location or building. In the private sector and from government-to-government, it is common to compensate usability study
participants for their time, and further for government researchers to compensate public participants. However, there are many issues with private sector compensating federal employees. Usability.gov states: “[If your participants are federal employees, you cannot pay them for their time](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/recruiting-usability-test-participants.html).”

However, the ETS2 Master Contract requires vendors to periodically test representative users:

>   *Section C.3.3.1 2) a. "Periodically conducting usability tests involving representative users. Such testing should occur in conjunction with the Contractor’s software development life cycle, prior to any release that involves changes to the ETS2 user interface;"*

E2 Solutions target audience/participants are geographically dispersed, requiring travel for them or the experimenters. Remote testing offers an opportunity to administer testing with a larger and diverse group of people than we might be able to accommodate in any lab environment at a vendor or agency, eliminating both the need for a lab environment and the effect of a lab environment on participants, while accommodating a more diverse groups of participants. Un-moderated testing further allows access to a larger pool of participants not possible with limited proctors. However, administrative or technical blocks from full participation were found to be common with agency users -- such as inability to install browser plugins or webinar software due to IT restrictions.

Although agency travelers are requested, in-person interviews often skew towards arrangers and administrators who tend to first hear about the opportunity to provide feedback. Obtaining volunteers representative of the user population and personas for varied testing continues to be a challenge to meeting this Master Contract requirement.

## Analysis And Reviews of Click-Stream Web Logs, Including Error Conditions, online Help Access Incidents, and Task Times and Completion/Abandonment Data

### Error Conditions

Document error rate is as important to understand as the speed of document completion. We seek to reduce both. CWTSatoTravel is seeking to expand methods of tracking and reporting key tasks for which there is a linear path to “complete” the task, and report on common workflow tasks that can be tracked over time. Error conditions may occur at page level, server level, or task and document level and consideration to reporting scope is necessary.

Task error rate of users testing prototype interfaces are commonly gathered in UX evaluations. Errors observed when completing tasks through user evaluations has been extensively reported in previous SAUARs or presentations has guided development effort and helped understand impact of improvements.

### Online help access incidents

E2 Solutions online help documentation software is provided by Oracle RightNow Technologies.

### <a name="CompletionData"></a> Completion Data, Task Conversion and Abandonment Data

The UCD/UE team continues to investigate the feasibility of reporting metrics around touchless bookings and rejected trips. It should be noted that the touchless rate is dependent on several factors other than usability, including trip complexity and agency policy (e.g., some agencies require all reservations that may result in the exchange of an unused ticket to be booked offline). The rejected document rate is dependent on outside factors as well, such as financial system and funding availability, as well as agency and departmental policy. While it is possible to expand this to a more granular level, it is not a trivial endeavor and reporting that requires development resources is weighted among other usability product improvement efforts.

-   Administrators and auditors, typically more advanced and familiar with E2 Solutions, use the application about twice as efficiently as travelers, and are the most satisfied users of E2.

-   Frequency of use increases satisfaction as is common and expected. Higher number of trips also similarly increases satisfaction. Increased length of use (beyond one year) slightly reduces satisfaction. We have noted this as unusual and sought feedback from users in October to understand assumptions.

-   Across document types, 12-18% of those users exit the workflow while estimating or declaring expenses, a common source of user frustration and area where some users need to complete offline tasks such as gathering their receipts.

-   Goal-conversion metrics for Authorizations, Vouchers, and Local Vouchers follow below. Of note:

    -   Authorization workflow
        -   In the Authorization process, \~20-25% of users appear to window-shop: the user leaves the site after creating reservations or returning from the OBE without further completing the Authorization during the session.
        -   46.8% of users start their Authorization and submit to an Approver on the first try.

    -   Voucher workflow
        -   60.2% of users complete their Voucher on the first try.

    -   Local Voucher workflow
        -   57.2% of users complete their Voucher on the first try.

E2 Help Desk Incident Reports
-----------------------------

CWTSatoTravel’s E2 Help Desk Incident reports from this POP are included in the Appendix. Observations of this information include:

-   Calls to unlock user accounts and other login issues have nearly doubled and become the highest cumulative call volume. This is expected with the onboarding of new users and increased use, and is consistent with implementation of the Drug Enforcement Agency during the POP.

| OBE (Online Booking Engine) \> Login \> Unlock Account    | 1,839 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Login Assistance \> Account locked                        | 1,436 |
| OBE (Online Booking Engine) \> Login \> User ID Retrieval | 882   |

-   Assistance with creating or managing reservations continues near the top of caller requests.

-   There were 2,111 calls for *Training and Resource Materials* – likely due agencies preparing their users for the UI Refresh.

-   Most ETS2 end users do not have direct access to CWTSatoTravel’s help desk to log incidents, as they go through their own Agency Tier 1 help desk. This means CWTSatoTravel reports may not contain the majority of “end-user” incidents for ETS2. Overall, the CWTSatoTravel Help Desk total incident counts rose to \~4,500/month.

### Feedback gleaned from users during ETS2 training

Task completion rate, time monitoring, and satisfaction were surveyed from attendees of training provided by CWTSatoTravel during the period of this report. Trainers followed the standard practice of documenting any issues identified during training sessions. These issues were evaluated and logged in our defect tracking software where warranted.

-   No usability issues were reported to UAM by trainers during this reporting period.

## Progress Mitigating Usability Issues in the SDLC 

User experience problems (name, description, and severity rating) are stored as common and understandable terms within defect tracking software, Test Director, accessed by CWTSatoTravel’s Customer Service Center, developers, and product support teams.

A common technique for assessing the impact of a problem is to assign impact scores according to the severity and occurrences of the problem. What follows is progress resolving defects marked as usability issues in E2 Solutions’ Software Development Lifecycle. These fixes may or may not yet be built into the Production baseline as these counts are reported directly from the Testing and Development Team’s defect tracking software. Following are net counts for remaining open defects identified in Test Director for “*Usability/Consistency*”:

[CHART]

<figcaption>Figure 33: Remaining Open Defects Counts</figcaption>

Unresolved “*Usability*” or “*Consistency*” items are classified into the following categories according to our defect prioritization system. No Block issues were reported nor remain unresolved.

| Severity    | Net Open Defects | % Total | Severity Description                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trivial** | 20               | 12%     | Idea, suggestion, or observation that could enhance the overall experience |
| **Minor**   | 93               | 58%     | Minor effect on task performance, delays user briefly, cosmetic |

Method of Determining Severity Ratings for Usability Problems 
--------------------------------------------------------------

If a user encounters a problem while attempting a task and it can be associated with the interface, it is considered a user interface problem. The usual method for measuring the frequency of occurrence of a problem is to divide the number of occurrences within participants by the number of participants. From an
analytical perspective, a useful way to organize UI problems is to associate them with the users who encountered them, as shown in this example of a *UI Problem Matrix*:

![UI Problem Matrix](./02222e1d5f6813e0e75ea2abbddb097f.png)

<figcaption>Note: The Xs represent users who encountered a problem. For example, user P3 encountered two problems.</figcaption>

### Recording Error Rates

Errors are any unintended action, slip, mistake, or omission a user makes while attempting a task. Error counts can go from 0 (no errors) to dozens. Errors provide excellent diagnostic information on why users are failing tasks and, where possible, are mapped to UI problems. Errors are assigned binary measures: the user either encountered an error (1 = yes) or did not (0 = no).

### Task Time

Task time is how long a user spends on an activity. It is most often the amount of time it takes users to successfully complete a predefined task scenario, but it can be total time on a web page or call length and is typically reported as an average. There are several ways of measuring and analyzing task duration:

-   *Task completion time* -- time of users who completed the task successfully
-   *Time until failure* -- time on task until users give up or complete the task incorrectly
-   *Total time on task* -- the total duration of time users spend on a task

### Task Satisfaction Ratings

Asking a question on how difficult users thought a task was to confidently complete is valuable when comparing to task completion rates. Even if task completion is at 100%, we also need to understand if users considered the task easy or difficult, and compare that to their expectations. By improving this mean satisfaction rating over time for a particular task one can measure how updated designs improved the user experience. Such subjective measures are especially helpful when evaluating tasks, even those with high “successful” completion rates. For example, a 100% completion rate cannot be improved, but a task that users struggle to complete and thought was difficult can be improved.

Follow-up [Single Ease Question](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/measuring-perceived-usability/) (SEQ) post-task questionnaires measure the perception of the ease of use of a system are commonly completed immediately after a task (post-task questionnaires), at the end of a usability session (post-test questionnaires), or outside of a usability test. Here is an example of a post-task survey:


![Single ease question rating scale](./seq.png)

<figcaption>The Single Ease Question, (SEQ) a single-question post-task questionnaire measures users’ perception of usability based on the last attempted task. Since the task is still fresh in the participants’ minds, their answer provides a useful assessment of the experience for that particular task.</figcaption>

### Determining Combined Scores

In general, users who quickly complete tasks tend to rate tasks as easier. Yet some users fail at tasks and still rate them as being easy, or others complete tasks quickly and report finding them difficult. Although usability metrics often significantly correlate, they don't correlate strongly enough that one metric can replace another, or stand alone. Reporting on multiple task metrics can be cumbersome over time, so it can be easier to combine metrics into a combined usability score. 

Further, combined usability score is a beneficial tool to use with non-design stakeholders. The simplicity and influence of a numerical score helps ensure usability research is digestible and impactful at a glance. 

UAM adopted 10-question System Usability Scale (SUS) and a much simpler metric to collect, the single-question NetPromoter&trade; (NPS) for tracking and measuring useful overall score(s) for usability in user evaluations or surveys. [SUS and NPS have a strong positive correlation](https://measuringu.com/nps-sus/) and can be used to forecast one another.

#### System Usability Scale (SUS)

The most well-known questionnaire used in UX research is the [System Usability Scale](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html). SUS provides a proven and reliable tool for measuring the usability.  It consists of a 10 item questionnaire with five response options for respondents; from *strongly agree* to *strongly disagree*. The participant’s scores for each question are added together and then multiplied by 2.5 to convert the original scores to 0-100.  Though the scores are 0-100, these are not percentages and should be considered only in terms of their percentile ranking vs. industry peers.

Based on research, a SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average and anything below 68 is below average

#### NetPromoter (NPS)

[NetPromoter&trade;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) is a well-established general bellwether even if it’s not as sensitive to UX-focused concerns. NPS is a single question about someone’s likelihood to recommend (LTR) a product: *“How likely are you to recommend this product to a friend or colleague?”* The response option is an 11-point scale numbered from 0 to 10 with higher numbers indicating higher likelihood to recommend. Promoters are those who choose a 9 or 10, detractors are those who choose anything 6 and below, with the 7-8’s as passive. The "net" in NetPromoter comes from how to score the response. NetPromoter is measured on a -100 to 100 scale. Subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters to get the Net Promoter Score. 

## Periodic Review of User Types, User Tasks, and Use Contexts

It is important for the UCD/UE to periodically review the critical goals of the ETS2 E2 Solutions product to ensure that E2 Solutions’ design and usability features take account of the evolving end-to-end travel process, not only for the needs of government travelers, but also travel arrangers and travel approvers.

### Personas

Personas add a real-world dimension when thinking through how users interact with the system, help focus usability design decisions, and test and prioritize features throughout the development process. Information collected from team members, and throughout various usability tests and assessments, can be used to update Persona characteristics, such as personal demographics, professional traits, and technical capabilities. Through the ETSNext initiative, CWTSatoTravel and ETS2 PMO Personas were merged to provide reliable and realistic representations of key users.

### Critical User Tasks 

Starting with the use cases provided by the ETS2 PMO as a baseline, the ETS2 E2 Solutions Team periodically updates critical user tasks within the ETS2 E2 Solutions application. Once the critical goals of the ETS2 E2 Solutions product are re-assessed, data can be analyzed from usability assessments to determine if critical tasks have changed, added, or become obsolete. This can be performed by periodically asking questions described on [usability.gov](https://www.usability.gov/sites/default/files/kickoff-meeting-questions.docx), such as:

-   What will users do when using E2 Solutions? (User tasks, content, features and functionality)
-   Which tasks are critical to users’ success on E2 Solutions? (Criticality)
-   Which tasks are most important to E2 Solutions users? (Importance)
-   Which features of the E2 Solutions will users use the most? (Frequency)
-   Which features are prone to usability issues? (Vulnerability)

These questions can be answered against user Personas, as previously described.
